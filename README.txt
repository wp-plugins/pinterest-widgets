Various widgets for Pinterest including the Follow button, Pin widget, Profile widget and Board Widget. Includes shortcodes.

== Description ==

Add simple Pinterest widgets to your site in minutes. Widgets behave and appear like those from the [official Pinterest widget builder](http://business.pinterest.com/widget-builder/).

Includes:

* Follow button: Invite people to follow you on Pinterest from your site.
* Pin widget: Embed one of your Pins on your site.
* Profile widget: Show up to 30 of your latest Pins on your site.
* Board widget: Show up to 30 of your favorite boardâ€™s latest Pins.
* Shortcodes for all 4 widgets.

The "Pin It" Button widget is *not* included in this plugin and is instead included in the separate [Pinterest "Pin It" Button plugin](http://pinplugins.com/pin-it-button-pro/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pinterest_widgets) ([Lite version](http://wordpress.org/plugins/pinterest-pin-it-button/) / [Pro version](http://pinplugins.com/pin-it-button-pro/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pinterest_widgets)), which we also created.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Your theme must implement **wp_footer()** in the footer.php file, otherwise JavaScript will not load correctly. You can test if this is the issue by switching to a WordPress stock theme such as twenty-twelve temporarily.

Shortcode help available within the plugin admin.
